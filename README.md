## Description
Pick-a-pass is a JavaScript-powered random password generator which utilizes a for loop and random number generator to choose characters from strings. Users can decide if they want numbers, special characters, upper- or lowercase letters in their passwords, and can also decide the length. 
This project was built using starter code (HTML, CSS and some JS) as part of an assignment for the UT Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp in Houston.
